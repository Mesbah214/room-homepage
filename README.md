## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss
- Vanilla Javascript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [GulpJS](https://gulpjs.com/) - JS library for build process

### Continued development

At this stage the image slider is barebone. The page has only a few animations. The accessibility needs to be enhanced.
